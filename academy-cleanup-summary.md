## 🔧 **Technical Challenges Solved:**

### **Foreign Key Constraint Issues:**
- **Problem:** Initial deletion attempts failed due to foreign key constraints
- **Solution:** Implemented proper cascading deletion order:
  1. PlayerStats → Feedback → Attendance → ScoutFavorite
  2. Players → Events → Matches → TrainingPlans  
  3. Users
  4. Academy (final)

### **Prisma Model Issues:**
- **Problem:** Prisma model didn't recognize new fields added via raw SQL
- **Solution:** Used raw SQL queries for data retrieval and proper relation names

### **API Endpoint Issues:**
- **Problem:** DELETE API wasn't handling cascading deletes properly

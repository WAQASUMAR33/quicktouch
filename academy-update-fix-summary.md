# Academy Update Button Fix - Summary

## Problem
The academy management edit modal's update button was not working properly due to the API not handling the new fields that were added to the Academy table.

## Root Cause
The PUT method in `/api/academy_management/[id]/route.js` was only handling the original fields:
- `name`, `location`, `description`, `contactEmail`, `contactPhone`, `adminIds`

But it was missing the new fields that were added:
- `contactPerson`
- `contactPersonPhone` 
- `status`
- `adminPassword`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated API Endpoint (`src/app/api/academy_management/[id]/route.js`)

#### GET Method Updates
- **Changed from Prisma model to raw SQL** to access all new fields
- **Added field selection** for all new fields in the query
- **Manual relation fetching** for Users, Players, Events, Matches, TrainingPlans
- **Proper error handling** for missing academies

#### PUT Method Updates
- **Added new field parameters** to request body destructuring
- **Updated validation** to include new fields
- **Raw SQL UPDATE query** using `COALESCE` for conditional updates
- **Complete field handling** for all academy fields
- **Proper response** with updated academy data including relations

### 2. Key Technical Changes

#### Request Body Handling
```javascript
const { name, location, description, contactEmail, contactPhone, 
        contactPerson, contactPersonPhone, status, adminIds } = await request.json();
```

#### Raw SQL Update Query
```sql
UPDATE Academy 
SET 
  name = COALESCE(?, name),
  location = COALESCE(?, location),
  description = COALESCE(?, description),
  contactEmail = COALESCE(?, contactEmail),
  contactPhone = COALESCE(?, contactPhone),
  contactPerson = COALESCE(?, contactPerson),
  contactPersonPhone = COALESCE(?, contactPersonPhone),
  status = COALESCE(?, status),
  adminIds = COALESCE(?, adminIds),
  updatedAt = NOW()
WHERE id = ?
```

#### Complete Data Retrieval
- **Raw SQL SELECT** to get all fields including new ones
- **Manual relation fetching** for complete academy data
- **Proper data structure** for frontend consumption

### 3. Benefits of the Fix
